<h1 id="what-i-know-about-bonds">What I know about Bonds</h1>
<p>A = OE + L</p>
<p>Remember this equation? From sometime back in Grade 9 accounting. It is the accounting equation and states that the assets of a business is equal to the sum of the business' owners' equity and liabilities. Here are some examples in action.</p>
<p>Say a business takes out a loan, the bank account of the business will increase with the new found money however, since the business still needs to eventually return the money, their liabilities must also increase. Alternatively if the business sells some of it's inventory (assets) at a profit that profit now belongs to the owner and hence the company's bank account and owner's equity increases. Perhaps if we rearranged the equation as follows, it would be insultingly obvious that whatever assets are left after paying back all liabilities is owed to the owner.</p>
<p>OE = A - L</p>
<p>With that out the way, we can see there are two ways a company can raise money (asset) to do business-y things. Either the business needs to sell more shares or the business takes out a loan. Raising money buying shares is typically more fimiliar. Although I wouldn't say is necessarily true if you are purchasing a share from someone else. That share is just trading hands and not necessarily generating new capital...but I digress. What company can do is take a loan from the people like you and me. We loan money to the company for a fixed amount of time and that company will agree to pay us back with interest. This is a bond contract. This is somewhat analogous to saving money in the bank through a savings account or fixed deposit. We'll tackle the question of which one is better after some quick observations.</p>
<h2 id="rapid-fire-observations">Rapid Fire Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bonds are safer investments than since if a business is goes bankrupt, they are obliged to pay their debt off first before paying off before the shareholders can claim anything</li>
<li>Bonds are issued with an agreed upon yeild</li>
<li>After entering a bond contract, you will only get your money back after the agreed upon date. This is referred to as maturity. If you want your money back sooner, you have the option of selling the bond to someone else.</li>
<li>If the person you sold the bond to is a sucker they might pay more than the price of the bond and expected interest. This is selling a bond at a premium. Alternatively if you're desparate to get back your money now you may have to sell your bond at a discount forfeiting expected returns.</li>
<li>I have not been able to find a stockbroker that'll allow you to buy individual bonds directly on the JSE debt market. However you can buy government bonds <a href="retailbonds.co.za">here</a>.</li>
<li>You can buy government bonds that have inflation linked interest rates.</li>
<li>Alternatively you can buy Bond ETFs (a collection of bonds that can be bought and traded like shares). Examples of these include: 1. SATRIX Government Bonds 2. SATRIX Inflation Linked Bonds</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relationship-between-interests-rates-and-bond-prices">Relationship between Interests Rates and Bond Prices</h2>
<p>Banks offer interest rates on their savings accounts, money market accounts (what are these?) and fixed deposits are rates somewhat similar to that of the repo rate. The repo rate is set by the government and details of which are way beyond me. Anyway say someone agreed to a bond 3 years ago at 10% maturing in a year. Now let's say the banks are going to decrease the interest rate of your savings account from 10% to 5%. Wouldn't you rather be earning the 10%? If that is the case more and more people would be willing to buy the bond therefore increasing it's price. Conversely if the interest rates at the bank increase, most would rather get a better return with the bank than waste time with the bond. Thereby decreasing bond prices. This brings us to the saying:</p>
<p>&quot;bond prices decrease with increasing interest rates and vice versa&quot;</p>
<h2 id="bonds-vs-shares">Bonds vs Shares</h2>
<p>Typically shares produce higher returns over time. This would be expected since ownership in a company is greater risk than just lending money to them. Benjamin Graham offers the advice of keeping a 50/50 split between bonds and shares. This ratio is to be adjusted depending on how long you want your money to be invested. If you in for the long run, then more shares and less bonds otherwise for short term-investing more bonds less shares.</p>
<p>With higher expected returns for shares over time why not just go all in for shares? This is a good idea however the stock market can sometimes some really scary periods where none of your shares are in the postive. Bonds are more typically stable and having some around when during the rough periods may allow you to sleep better at night.</p>
