<p>During my third year at varsity, I elected to do a course in business ethics. The course was taught by the philosophy department. I am extremely glad that I had taken as it formally introduced me to logical reasoning and cognitive biases. I geniunly think that identifying these logical shortfalls will hopefully make me a better decision maker. In this post I will address some of the fallicies and biases that I think I most often fall prey to.</p>
<h3 id="appeal-to-hypocrisiy">1. Appeal to Hypocrisiy</h3>
<p>This is fallacy occurs if I dismiss an argument because the person who is stating lives a life different to the point they're trying to make. As an example, I may dismiss a smoker who is arguing that smoking is unhealthy. This example however illustrates that we can engage with a hypocrite because despite them not living in accordance to their stated arguments does not mean the arguments themselves are any less valid.</p>
<h3 id="appeal-to-authority">2. Appeal to Authority</h3>
<p>It always feels good when someone agrees with your beliefs. It feels even better when those people are accomplished and successful. However again believing something just because the someone else said it is the easy way out in logical thinking. I need to be reminded that we responisbility is on us to make sense of the world than just to relying on the views of accomplished individuals or even the general population (this is instead referred to as an ad populum fallacy). Of course it is impossible to learn the facts of every single area of study and draw your own conclusions on every single issue. In those cases it is best to defer to the expert but probably should also mean you abstain from hottly debating such issues.</p>
<h3 id="berksons-paradox">3. Survivorship Bias</h3>
<p>I really like this war story of an army trying to figure out where to reinforce their aircraft after battle. Iniitially they decided to reinforce the areas of the planes which were most riddled with bullet holes. It is was a mathematician who stopped them and decided to reinforce the areas which hardly had any bullet holes. This was because the army had collected their data from the planes had had arrived back and didn't take into account that there were planes that didn't. These planes were able arrive back with bullet holes in thoe areas meaning those areas were less critical to plane function. So the moral of this story is when interpreting statistical results, always consider the indirect assumptions you are making with your sample population.</p>
<h3 id="confirmation-bias">4. Confirmation bias</h3>
<p>Like I've mentioned earlier it is always feels great to listen to people who share the same outlook as you. Google and YouTube knows this and feeds you information that most closely fits your world view. This is probably a good reason to protect your privacy and avoid companies from tracking you, but I digress. An example of me falling to confirmation bias is whilst I continue to learn about cryptocurrencies and all their contraversies, I would prefer watching videos that are in-line with my initial opinion. When I catch myself doing this I try challenge watching a video that is opposite to what I think, however uncomfortable it my be.</p>
